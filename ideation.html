        <h3>My Website Idea</h3>
        <p>
                So i want to create a budget website where users can track their spendings.
            I think not being able to track your spendings most of the time will lead you to
            spend more than your earnings and that will lead you to accumulate more 
            debt.  I think debt free will really lead a person, at least for myself to 
            a more happy life.<br/>
            
                My website will be able store the data of earnings and spendings.  It will 
            be able to alert me if i spend more than i make, meaning my balance sheet is 
            negative. It will be able to let me know what items or categories i spend too much etc...<br/> 
            
                There are many website outthere where you can track and manage your finance, but 
            i think those are too complicate compare with what i have in mind for my website.   
            Few websites that i can think of is:<br/>
                1, https://www.personalcapital.com<br/>
                2, https://www.tillerhq.com<br/>

            These are just a few that i thought of.<br/> 
            
            Your insight will be greatly appreciated. 
        </p>
